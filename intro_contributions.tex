The thesis' main contribution to the field of machine learning is the examination of different approaches that can reduce the impact of inconsistent labeling. This involves experiments conducted on semantic road labeling task which has a high rate of naturally occurring inconsistent labeling. Experiments demonstrated that curriculum learning improved the generalization accuracy of a deep neural network, trained with real-world datasets. Furthermore, the thesis shows that a curriculum teacher based on estimating the inconsistency between a model prediction and a label can be an effective approach for curriculum learning. Whether the bootstrapping loss function can reduce the effect of inconsistent labeling is unclear. Experiments testing the bootstrapping loss function were, unfortunately, inconclusive.
