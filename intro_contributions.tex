{\it
The thesis' main contribution to the field of machine learning  is the examination of different approaches for reducing the impact of inconsistent labelling, and experiments conducted on semantic road labelling task which have a high rate of naturally occurring inconsistent labelling. Experiments demonstrated that curriculum learning improved the generalization accuracy of a classifier, when training with real-world datasets. Furthermore the thesis shows that a curriculum teacher based on inconsistency between model prediction and label can be effective for curriculum learning.}\todo{What about bootstrapping}

\begin{enumerate}
\item {\it The effectiveness of curriculum learning for real-world datasets}
\item {\it A generally applicable curriculum teacher based on ordering examples based on inconsistency between model prediction and example label}
\item {\it A new aerial image dataset covering a large area of the Norwegian road system.}
