The thesis' main contribution to the field of machine learning  is the examination of different approaches that can reduce the impact of inconsistent labelling, and experiments conducted on semantic road labelling task which has a high rate of naturally occurring inconsistent labelling. Experiments demonstrated that curriculum learning improved the generalization accuracy of a deep neural network, trained with real-world datasets. Furthermore, the thesis shows that a curriculum teacher based on estimating inconsistency between a model prediction and a label can be effective for curriculum learning.
