The thesis' main contribution to the field of machine learning  is the examination of different approaches for reducing the impact of inconsistent labelling, and experiments conducted on semantic road labelling task which have a high rate of naturally occurring inconsistent labelling. Experiments demonstrate that curriculum learning can improve the learning performance of models when training with real-world datasets. Furthermore the thesis shows that a curriculum teacher based on inconsistency between model prediction and label can be effective for curriculum learning.}
