\section{Implementation Details}
\label{sec:methods_implementation_details}
The road extraction system was written with Python, and uses the open source library Theano. Theano enables the user to define and evaluate mathematical expressions involving tensors. The library implements several useful features for developing \ac{CNN}s, such as back-propagation, convolution, and max pooling. Training deep neural networks on a \ac{GPU} can be considerably faster than on a \ac{CPU}. Theano can utilize both the \ac{CPU} and \ac{GPU} without making any modifications to the code.\\
