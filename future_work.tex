incorporate conditional random fields, or post processing neural network. Will yield further improvements.\\

Is it worth including every example at later stages of learning. What works better between filtering and curriculum learning. Exclude some examples?\\

How inexperienced can a teacher model be, and still be able to create an effective curriculum.\\

Further cleanup of prediction images, and converting the segmented road areas into road-centerline vectors. \\

Compare SPL methods to the curriculum approach presented in this thesis.\\

Estimate variability of examples, diverse set of examples in the simple dataset.\\

\todo[inline]{Some larger tests but runtime too large for extensive testing with these quantities}
