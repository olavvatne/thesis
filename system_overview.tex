\section{System Overview}
\label{sec:systemOverview}
\todo[inline]{Super overview.
Dataset loader (Pre generated or otherwise) Convolutional neural network. Storage. webGUI and in file
}
\todo[inline]{In big terms, talk about finding roads, but as mnih. Datasets contain two label noise. Investigate ways of mitigating the impact label noise have. Also the aerial image datasets contain large variety of images. Some are much harder. Epecially when inconsistent labelling. Curriculum learning. }

\todo[inline]{Too many details presented here. This should be much shorter and give a birds view of the entire system }

\todo[inline]{dataloader short intro}
\todo[inline]{Data loader and network loosely coupled. Can adapt system to other image problems easily. All hyperparameters can be changed in a config file. From number of layers, epochs etc etc. What backpropagation method}

\todo[inline]{Short intro to CNN}
\todo[inline]{Reasons to use CNN. Related work , compelling results. CNN extract features. Suited for image task. }


\todo[inline]{Mention the webgui. Store results and display stuff}

\todo[inline]{Maybe frame it as three different way to combat label noise. CNN -robustness, bootstrapping -- and curriculum learning filtering technique}
