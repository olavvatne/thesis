To address the research questions outlined in Section \ref{sec:Goals and Research Questions}, a \ac{CNN} has been developed. An aerial image dataset containing ground truth for roads have been acquired from \citep{MnihThesis}, and is publicly available under the name Massachusetts Roads Dataset. Additionally, a new dataset containing parts of the Norwegian road network has been created using aerial images and road center-line vectors provided by Kartverket.\\   

These datasets will be used for training and testing the performance of the system, as well as evaluating the research questions. Furthermore, by utilizing a publicly available dataset, the system presented in the thesis can be compared to the performance of other similar systems \citep{Mnih_aerial_images_noisy}\citep{MnihThesis}\citep{saito_building_and_roads}.
