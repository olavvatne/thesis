\section{Experimental Setup}
\label{sec:experimentalSetup}
\todo[inline]{The experimental setup should include all data - parameters etc, that would allow a person to repeat your experiments.}
\begin{itemize}
\item ml-monitor. Json file for every experiment.
\item For curriculum learning trained for similar number of epochs, with same amount of training data.
\end{itemize}

For comparsion experiments. No recall slack.
To propertly compare with - use slack for recall as well. Mistake when calc the stuff.
