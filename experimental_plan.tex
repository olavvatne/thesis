\begin{itemize}
\item Comparison baseline model and curriculum model
\item Comparison crossentropy and bootstrapping for several
levels of label degradation. 
\item Test curriculum for different dataset sizes. Will advantage of curriculum disappear for larger datasets?
\item Larger dataset for bootstrapping?
\item Can curriculum learning combined with bootstrapping loss function further improve results for label noise?
\item How much does the competence of the curriculum teacher affect the results of curriculum learning?
\end{itemize}
