\todo[inline]{Is this part necessary?}
In this section a brief discussion of what elements in this chapter have influenced the thesis project.

\begin{itemize}
\item Training with datasets with unreliable supervision signal
\item Using a curriculum to improve performance of models. Estimating reliability of 
examples in dataset to create a transition from easy to hard samples. Based on 
evidence that samples earlier in training have bigger influence than examples seen later in training process. As well as inconsistent labels having an adverse effect on 
training.
\item Curriculum teacher (Alternatives for this)
\item Aerial dataset contain noise. Hinton showed methods can improve performance. Test alternative methods that are generally applicable. \todo{Need better word for expressing this} for dataset.
Experiment with other more general techniques to achieve robustness.
\item find roads in images require structured output. CNN 
\item Good dataset to test whether curriculum learning and measures to limit inconsistent labelling work. Dataset with real world applications, complex.
\end{itemize}
