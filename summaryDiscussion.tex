\label{sec:SummaryDiscussion}

-Present the goal. And that performance in terms of breakeven point lower than other works.
Still usable. Refer to qualitative stuff.
Focus of research question related to label noise in aerila image datasets. 
 
 This section will attempt to resolve the research questions defined in Section \ref{sec:Goals and Research Questions} by a brief discussion based on the results from Chapter \ref{cha:ResearchAndResults}.
\begin{description}
\item[Research question 1] Does the bootstrapping loss function give a significant improvement of precision and recall for datasets with noisy labels?
\end{description}

-Reference to other works, and good results from these.\\
-Answer\\
\todo[inline]{Merits and limitations}


\begin{description}
\item[Research question 2]  How can curriculum learning improve results in deep learning, and does this improve precision and recall for aerial images?
\end{description}

-Reference to studies from related works. Experiment using images, only a toy example. Separating shapes bases on geometrical attributes. Not that simple with aerial images. Spd, modify the model. Possible to create a curriculum dataset trained with a ordinary deep neural network.\\
-Explain curriculum strategy\\
-Experiments supporting improvement, every result showed improved precision and recall\\
